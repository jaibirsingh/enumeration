# Ways to enumerate users

1. Using nmap scripts
   * `nmap -p 445 --script smb-enum-shares [IP]`
  
2. Using metasploit modules
   * `auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_enumshares`
  
3. Using enum4linux
   * `enum4linux -S [IP]`
  
# Ways to enumerate groups

**Advantage to enumerate groups**: A user might not have a specific access but getting  an access to a group can give that access.
1. Using enum4linux
   * `enum4linux -G [IP]`
  
2. Using rpcclient
   * `rpcclient -U "" -N [IP]` ---> `enumdomgroups`
  
# To check if any printers are configured on the target system
1. Using enum4linux
   * `enum4linux -i [IP]
  
***
* As we might have noticed while enumerating the users that the user named 'Public' was accessible, so we will try to see its shared folders and files usng the commmand:
  * `smbclient //[IP]/Public -N` ---> `ls` --->and get whatever folder and file you want to explore.
  * To download the file named 'flag' inside the smbclient: `get flag` (This will download the files from the shared system) ----> exit the smbclient ---> cat flag.
