# SMB: Windows Discover and Mount

* **Step 1**: run ipconfig to know your ipv4 address
* **Step 2**: Use that ipv4 either to run nmap within the subnet of this ipv4 or calculate the network address using ipv4 and subnet mask and then run nmap on that network address with CIDR notation derived from the subnet mask.
* **Step 3**: Find the target with an open port number 445, because that's where the SMB service is running under the name of "microsoft-ds".
* **Step 4**: Then put that IP in "target" section of the "Map network drive..." by right-clickingon the "Network" in "This PC" section.
* **Step 5**: Once the target IP is put in we can click "Browse" and select the desired drive on the target system.
* **To delete the mapped network drive**:
  `net use * /delete`
* **To retreive the deleted drive**:
  `net use Z: \\[Target IP]\C$ [password] /user:[username]`

* **Calculation 1**: Network address = Convert IPv4 and subnet mask to binary and run an AND operation on these two values.
* **Calculation 2**: Total number of hosts on the subnet = 2^ (number of 0s on right-most portion of binary subnet mask). Eg: subnet mask = 255.255.240.0 will have 12 0s on the right most of its binary notation.,i.e., 2^12 = 4096 addresses in this subnet.
* **Calculation 3**: CIDR notation = Total number of network bits in subnet mask, i.e., number of consecutive 1s in the binary notation of the subnet mask counting from left.
