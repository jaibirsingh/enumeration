Common tasks that SMBmap can perform:

* Enumerate shares: SMBmap can list available shared folders and drives on a remote Windows machine.

* Enumerate files and directories: It can list the contents of shared folders and subdirectories, providing information about file names, sizes, and permissions.

* Access files: SMBmap allows users to download files from remote shares to a local system.

* Check for writable shares: It can identify shares that have write access permissions, potentially indicating a security issue.

* Map drives: SMBmap can map remote shares to local drive letters, making it easier to access shared resources.

1. Check with nmap smb-protocols if smbv1 is operating, then it can be enumerated using null session of smbmap

# smbmap with null session
`smbmap -u guest -p "" -d . -H [target-IP]`

# smbmap with administrator access
`smbmap -H [target-IP] -u administrator -p [password] -x 'ipconfig'` where -x receives the command to be run, which in this case is ipconfig

# smbmap to list the contents of the remote directory 
` smbmap -H [target IP] -u administrator -p [password] -L`

# Connect to a drive
smbmap -H [IP] -u administrator -p [password] -r 'C$'

# Add file to the windows system
* Check the current files present: `ls`
* Add an empty file using : `touch [name of the file]`
* Upload this file to C drive of the remote system: `smbmap -H 10.0.30.19 -u administrator -p 'smbserver_771' --upload '/root/backdoor' 'C$\testdoor'`
* View this file 'testdoor' on the remote system: `smbmap -H 10.0.30.19 -u administrator -p 'smbserver_771' -r 'C$'
* Download the file named 'flag.txt' from the remote system:
  `smbmap -H 10.0.30.19 -u administrator -p 'smbserver_771' --download 'C$\flag.txt'`
