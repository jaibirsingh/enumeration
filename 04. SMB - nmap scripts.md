# nmap dialects
* In the context of Nmap (Network Mapper), "dialects" typically refer to the various scripting languages and libraries available for scripting and automation within Nmap.
* Nmap provides a powerful scripting engine called the Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) that allows users to write custom scripts to extend Nmap's functionality.
* These scripts can be written in different scripting languages, and they are referred to as "dialects" in the context of NSE.
***
The primary scripting languages or dialects used in Nmap scripting are:

* Lua: Lua is the primary scripting language used for writing Nmap scripts. It is a lightweight, embeddable scripting language known for its simplicity and efficiency. Most Nmap scripts are written in Lua.

* NSE Libraries: Nmap includes a set of libraries and APIs that facilitate script development in Lua. These libraries provide functions and data structures for common networking tasks and interactions.

* Python and other languages: While Lua is the most commonly used language for Nmap scripting, NSE also supports other scripting languages like Python. Users can write scripts in these languages, and Nmap will execute them using the appropriate interpreter.
***
* Nmap scripts, written in these dialects, can be used to perform a wide range of tasks during network reconnaissance, vulnerability scanning, and network assessment.
* These scripts can be used to automate various tasks such as service enumeration, vulnerability detection, and more.

# SMB nmap scripts
 `nmap [target-IP] -p 445 --script [name of the script]
 * where "name of the script" could be:
  1. smb-protocols
  2. smb-security-mode  ---> this will point out if any default configurations are dangerous
  3. smb-enum-sessions ---> Users logged in
  4. smb-enum-sessions --script-args smbusername=[usernmae],smbpassword=[password]
  5. smb-enum-shares
  6. smb-enum-shares, smb-ls --script-args smbusername=[username],smbpassword=[password]  ---> List command
  7. smb-enum-users ----> which users exist
  8. smb-server-stats --script-args smbusername=[username,smbpassword=[password]
  9. smb-enum-domains --script-args smbusernmae=[username],smbpassword=[password]
  10. smb-enum-groups --script-args smbusername=[usernmae],smbpassword=[password]
  11. smb-enum-services --script-args smbusernmae=[username],smbpassword=[password]
